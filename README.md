# ThinkOrSwim Scripts/Scans

## Scripts

##### Cloud Bollinger Bands
- Modifies thinkorswim's bollinger band version to add cloud effect

#####  Mean Expansion Contraction
- Modify PPO so that you can plot 2 moving averages onto same plot for better visual
- Kind of like a MACD but use with Price from Mean and RSI to find reversals
- 10MA vs 20MA and 20MA vs 50MA

#####  Percentages
- Plots percentage draw downs by increments of 10%
- Uses highest open/close and lowest open/close to plot 0 - 100%
- Optional adds are 2 extensions from highest open/close and lowest open/close

#####  Price From Mean
- Plots percentage price is away from specified mean
- Can plot 2 moving averages
- Use 10EMA and 20EMA

#####  Relative Performance
- Plots relative performance of a security compared to SPX and QQQ indexes

#####  RSI 60-50-40
- Modified RSI to include 60-50-40 lines
- Includes cloud effect on oversold/overbought areas

#####  Swing Pivot
- Identifies big institutional buys on the hourly timeframe; usually first hour
- Good for finding reversals from short term pullback/downtrend; candle will be solid green and high volume
- The more signals that occur more likely institutional buyers bidding up the price
- Script also plots from highs/lows of the day and color coordinates green for uptrend, red for downtrend, and white for neutral
- *Only works for the 1 hour timeframe*
